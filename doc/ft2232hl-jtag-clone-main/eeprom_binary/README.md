This folder already have 2 binary from 2 different board.

1. Digilent SMT1 for FT2232HL base board.

2. Digilent HS2 for FT232H base board (from Microphase board).

3. Digilent HS1 for FT232H base board (from Aliexpress).

I don't know if HS1 & HS2 make a different when in use in ISE/Vivado. Only test it on Vivado, because never used ISE anymore. Place it all here just in case.
